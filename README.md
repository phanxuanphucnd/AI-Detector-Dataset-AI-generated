# Detect-AI-Generated-Text

I collected three new datasets of human- and AI-generated text as detection benchmarks in the domains of student essays, creative writing, and news articles. These can be found under the data folder. Each dataset also contains a logprobs folder, which consists of files of the form X-ada.txt and X-davinci.txt, corresponding to token-wise logprobs when running the document X.txt under ada and davinci.
